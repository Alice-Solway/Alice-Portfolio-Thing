     <h1>My Three Favorite Mac Glocky Covers</h1>
     <p>Mac Glocky has put over 40 covers of songs, styled to sound as if another band had written them. Here are three of my favourites. Please note that these are not ordered.</p>

         <h2>Careless Whisper (CKY Styled)</h2>
         <p>In the first Fantasy Covers album, Mac created a rendition of the incredibly popular song "Careless Whisper" by George Michael. This was styled as if to have been written by the group CKY, and resembles some of their work off of Infiltrate Destroy Rebuild.</p>

             <h2>Semi-Charmed Life (Incubus Styled)</h2>
             <p>In Mac Glocky's second Fantasy Covers album, he did an Incubus inspired cover of Third Eye Blind's "Semi-Charmed Life". The sound of the final work resembles what one might find if they were to listen to Incubus' album S.C.I.E.N.C.E.. I adore the original version of the song, and his cover gives a new way to appreciate the masterpiece.</p>

             <h2>Teenage Dirtbag (cheVelle Styled)</h2>
             <p>In the fourth and most recent installment as of writing, Mac Glocky's Fantasy Covers features a cover of the Wheatus song Teenage Dirtbag as if it were a cheVelle song. Regretably I do not know much about cheVelle, though I am in love with every cheVelle cover Mac has put out over the years. This, of course, is my favorite of the three.</p>
