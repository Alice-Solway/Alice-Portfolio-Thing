       <h1>Very Good Rice</h1><!-- call it something better -->
       <p>Hello friends, today I shall do my best to explain to you how to make the greatest rice I have ever made. I found it to not only be the greatest tasting meal I have ever cooked, but perhaps also one of the greatest things I have ever eaten overall.</p>
       <p>While specific measurements will be granted, rice is a very flexible item to cook, and the liquid used and their proportion relative to your rice can be tweaked to your liking. This recipe however will be using a mix of chicken broth (for flavor) and milk (for flavor, though also helps the texture), and the total amount of liquid will be1:1.5 parts rice to liquid.</p>
        <p>You will also want a small pot with a lid for the rice to cook in, and a pan to cook your meat in.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>Nuetral Oil</li>
         <li>Spices of Your Choosing</li>
         <li>Rice (1/2 cup)</li>
         <li>Chicken Broth (1/2 cup, or an equal volume to the rice)</li>
         <li>Milk (1/4 cup, or half as much as your rice volume)</li>
         <li>Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (as much as you'd like, and other cheeses may be used instead)</li>
         <li>Ground Beef (1/3lb, or however much you'd like)</li>
       </ul>
      <p>Personally, for my spices, I use garlic powder, black pepper, and a lot of red pepper (you can of course though use whatever spices you'd like). I add these to both the rice pot and to the meat as it cooks.</p>
      <p>For the cheese, I've only ever used parmigiano reggiano, but you can use any amount of any cheese you want.</p>

       <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <ol>
         <li>With your neutral oil, cover the bottom of your rice pot.</li>
         <li>Add your spice mix into your thin layer of oil. This is to toast your spices, bringing out the flavor, and to distribute them more evenly than adding them directly to the rice.</li>
         <li>While you allow the spices to temper, wash your rice (rinse it until the water runs clear).</li>
         <li>Once the spices have been toasted to your liking, add your liquids to this pot, and give it a light stir.</li>
         <li>After mixing your rice fluids, add your washed rice to the pot, cover it, and wait while it cooks. The amount of time varies based on pot and burner size, as well as the amount of rice and liquid being used. In my experience, this takes about 11 minutes.</li>
         <li>While your rice is cooking, you should have your beef over another source of heat to cook. Allow to cook until desired doneness.</li>
         <li>Once the rice and meat have both been fully cooked, add both of them to either a serving bowl, or the bowl you will eat out of. Add your cheese, and mix well</li>
         <li>Enjoy your meal!</li>
